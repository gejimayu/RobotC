# RobotC
Make a Robot that follows a black line in a maze to find a fire source and then come back to starting point.<br>
There are 2 versions of this, one using Breadth-First Search algorithm and another one using Depth-First Search Algorithm <br>
We use C as the programming language and ROBOTC for the robot simulation. <br>
We use this particular robot https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/products/31313-mindstorms-ev3 <br>
